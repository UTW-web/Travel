              This is my path. A path through lands, flavors, experiences, and feelings...
              At heart, I'm a nomad, and my soul's journey is one of exploration, tasting, creating, sensing, and connecting.

              If you're looking for classic travel blogs,
              you won't find them here.
              But you will find many sincere reflections and feelings from my journey.

              My name is Maria.
              For a long time, I believed that the meaning of life was in work, parenting, and everyday survival—but deep inside, I felt there was something more calling me.
              And that's how love for myself was born—
              alongside the exploration of my own depths.
